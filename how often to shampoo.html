            <p>Do you feel like you need to shampoo every single day because your hair just gets too dirty and greasy? And somehow, your hair still feels dry? We hate to break this to you, but your shampoo could be to blame.

                Traditional shampoos often contain a lot of questionable ingredients: sulfates, parabens, silicones, fillers — the list goes on and on. If your hair is in a tizzy and you can’t figure out why, it may be time to make the switch to a gentle shampoo bar. 
                
                What makes our shampoo bars the best option for fussy hair, you ask? Allow us to break it down: </p>
            
<p>According to celebrity hairstylist Ken Paves better known for his work on David Beckham also warns against the use of shampoo daily. Paves who has also worked with stars like Jennifer Lopez and Jessica Simpson recommends washing your hair two to three times a week.</p>
<p>Skipping shampoo daily does not mean you should avoid washing your hair for too long. Washing less not only makes your hair untidy, greasy, and stinky but also results in an excessive build-up of oils in the scalp. The excessive oils in the scalp lead to an overgrowth of yeast naturally found on the skin resulting in dandruff.</p>
<p>Besides dandruff, the excess oils in the scalp also aggravate hair loss as these oils can trap DHT in the hair follicles of the scalp. DHT or Dihydrotestosterone is the hormone responsible for male pattern baldness</p>
