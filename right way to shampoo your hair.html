            <p>It should be so simple: Squirt some hydrating shampoo into your palm, work it into your hair until it’s a rich luxurious froth, and rinse. But somewhere along the way, things got a bit complicated. Co-washes, second-day stylers, dry shampoo—there are more products than ever designed to help you lather up less. But is that a good thing? There are so many ways to wash, but only one correct way to learn how to shampoo your hair. </p>
            <p>Certified trichologist Sophia Emmanuel isn’t so sure: “You have to understand that, despite their names, co-washes and dry shampoo do not cleanse your hair the way regular shampoo will,” she says. They should be used sparingly—and only in conjunction with a traditional shampoo.</p> 
            <p>But a once-a-day wash isn’t necessarily appropriate for everyone—your washing schedule really depends upon your hair type, says celebrity stylist Mia Santiago, whose clients include Mariska Margitay, Martha Stewart, Christina Hendricks, and Dove Cameron. She recommends gauging your routine based on the thickness of your hair. </p>
            <p>Medium-to-thick types can get by with two to three washes per week and even those with texture type 4 hair should still wash at least once a week, says Emmanuel. “If you have a particularly oily scalp or use a lot of waxy or oil-based hair products, you may need to shampoo a bit more, no matter your hair type,” she explains.
